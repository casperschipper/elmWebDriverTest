# Elm WebDriver Test

This is a personal test for Elm WebDriver. 

# Preperation

You will need to set up a selenium server, which is some JAVA jar.
You can get the jar here: <https://www.selenium.dev/downloads/>
You will have to install a chromedriver, geckodriver or a webdriver of your choice. By default this uses the chrome driver.

You start the server like this:

`java -jar selenium-server-standalone-*.jar`

It should automatically detect your installed webdriver(s).

Go to localhost:4444, go to the console, and create a session with the browser of your choice.

You will have to do an `npm install` for the node dependencies (XMLHttpRequest).

# Building and running

Use the build.sh script to build, this makes the elm code and injects the XMLHttpRequest, which is needed for Elm Webdriver, which is not available in Node.js by default.

`sh build.sh`

Then run: 

`node main.js`

It will load http://knmi.nl in chrome and a simple test on the <title> tag. 
If it passes you see a green period <span style="color:green">.</span>, otherwise a red <span style="color:red">F</span>.
